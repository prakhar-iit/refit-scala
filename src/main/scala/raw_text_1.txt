If you want to use keyed state, you first need to specify a key on a DataStream that should be used to partition the state. You can specify a key using keyBy in Java/Scala API or key_by in Python API on a DataStream. This will yield a KeyedStream, which then allows operations that use keyed state.
A key selector function takes a single record as input and returns the key for that record. The key can be of any type and must be derived from deterministic computations.
The data model of Flink is not based on key-value pairs. Therefore, you do not need to physically pack the data set types into keys and values. Keys are “virtual”: they are defined as functions over the actual data to guide the grouping operator.If you want to use keyed state, you first need to specify a key on a DataStream that should be used to partition the state.
